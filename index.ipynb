We will be working with a very large dataset containing information on rent and population demographics in the US. We will be using the ETL pattern to create extract, format (or transform), and enter (or load) our data into our database. Let's get started!"

Our package should have an `__init__.py` file that imports Dash and instantiates a new app with a `url_base_pathname` of `'/dashboard'`.

Since we have nearly 40,000 rows in our excel file, we can think about starting to aggregate some of this information. Since cities are broken up into boroughs or neighborhoods, we need to figure out how to iterate through our data to only create one city and the demographics for that city will be an aggregate or average of the information for each part of a given city. For example, in lieu of creating demographics for New York's 5 Boroughs, Staten Island, Queens, The Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan, we will aggregate or average the demographic individual statistics into one and then use the calculated totals and averages to create one demographic object for New York.\n",

Next, use the data and the state's id in the database to find or create a new city object, and lastly, use the the city object's id to find or create a new demographic object in the database.
